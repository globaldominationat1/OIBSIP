                Draupadi also referred to as Krishnaa, Panchali and Yajnaseni, is the female
                protagonist of the Hindu epic, Mahabharata and the consort of the five Pandava
                brothers—Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva. She is noted for her 
                beauty, courage and a rare polyandrous marriage.
                Draupadi was born from fire.
                Draupadi is described to be extremely beautiful. Vyasa—the author of the Mahabharata
                —describes her having a dark complexion, lotus-like eyes, beautiful copper nails,
                dark curly hair and an enchanting fragrance like that of a blue lotus.She is the
                ultimate goddess with fiery confidence and unmatchable personality. The most notable
                incident in Draupadi's life is the game of dice at Hastinapur where Yudhishthira loses
                his possessions and wife, and she is humiliated by the Kaurava brothers and Karna.
                An attempt is made by Dushasana to disrobe her but she is saved by divine intervention. 
                Lord Krishna saved her and the whole dyut sabha was cursed by her.
                Draupadi was the reason for the happening of the epic tale Mahabharat,which was the
                battle of good vs evil.
